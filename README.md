# AI-Voice-Assistant-for-Campus
This project endeavors to craft an AI-supported voice-activated personal assistant tailored explicitly for the unique needs of colleges and universities. The AI assistant is powered by advanced speech recognition, natural language processing, and voice response generation technologies. It can answer questions, provide reminders, schedule appointments, and more.

1. Getting Started
This project requires the following software and tools:

Python 3.x
Node.js 14.x
Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
PyCharm IDE
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Git

2. Technology Overview
The AI Assistant for College project consists of the following components:

Speech Recognition: Uses the Python SpeechRecognition library to convert spoken words into text.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Uses the spaCy library to extract entities and perform language understanding.
Voice Response Generation: Uses the Google Text-to-Speech API to generate natural and human-like voice responses.
Cloud Services Integration: Uses the Flask web framework to build a lightweight web application and Google Cloud Platform for hosting and integrating cloud services.


3. System Architecture
The AI Assistant for College project consists of the following main components:

A Python-based speech recognition module that converts spoken words into text.
A Python-based NLP module that extracts entities and performs language understanding.
A Node.js-based voice response generation module that uses the Google Text-to-Speech API to generate voice responses.
A Python-based web application built with Flask that provides a REST API for interacting with the AI assistant.
A Google Cloud Platform infrastructure that hosts the web application and provides cloud services.
